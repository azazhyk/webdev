   Motivated student, ready to work. I am constantly learning and improving my skills. 
   Responsible for assigned tasks and deadlines. I plan to become a full-stack developer, 
   as I have a great interest in software and web development. 
   I am also interested in studying UI/UX design and artificial intelligence.

  <br><br>

  Since school, I have been interested in programming. 
  I was born and lived until 2022 in Ukraine in the city of Chernihiv. 
  Entered the bachelor's degree at the Chernihiv Polytechnic National University, 
  majoring in computer engineering. Currently, I have excellent results - more than 95% success rate. 
  Now I am continuing my studies in the 3rd year online.
  
  <br><br> 

  Since May 2022, I have been living in Sevenoaks, England.
  In July of 2022, I had an internship at a global specialized firm with headquarters in London.
